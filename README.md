`mpmm` is an R package that fits movement persistence mixed-effect
models to animal tracking data for inference of linear relationships
with covariates, accounting for individual variability (Jonsen et
al. 2019. Ecology 100:e02566). Random effects are assumed to be
approximately normal. It is assumed that the location data are either
relatively error-free (e.g., GPS locations) or filtered estimates from a
state-space model fitted to error-prone data (e.g., Argos locations).
Models are specified using standard mixed-model formulas, as you would
in `lme4` or `glmmTMB`. The underlying code for specifying and
estimating fixed and random effects borrows heavily on `glmmTMB` code,
but is implemented in a more limited manner in `mpmm`. Currently, for
example, only diagonal or unstructured covariances are possible;
interaction terms are not possible; grouping term is always assumed to
be the individual animal `id` (or individual sub-tracks `tid`).

## Installation

First, ensure you have R version &gt;= 3.6.0 installed (preferably R
4.0.0 or higher):

``` r
R.Version()
```

### From GitHub (source)

On PC’s running Windows, ensure you have installed
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

On Mac’s, ensure you have installed the [Command Line Tools for
Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) by executing
`xcode-select --install` in the terminal; or you can download the latest
version from the URL (free developer registration may be required). A
full Xcode install uses up a lot of disk space and is not required.

Currently, `mpmm` can only be installed from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ianjonsen/mpmm")
```

Note: there can be issues getting compilers to work properly, especially
on a Mac with OS X 10.13.x or higher. If you encounter install and
compile issues, I recommend you consult the excellent information on the
[glmmTMB](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB) GitHub.

## Basic example

`mpmm` fits mixed models and facilitates model selection, validation and
visualisation of estimated covariate relationships:

``` r
library(mpmm)

fit <-
  mpmm(
    ~ ice + sal_diff + (ice |
               id),
    data = ellie.ice,
    control = mpmm_control(
      REML = TRUE,
      verbose = 0 # turn off parameter trace for tidy output
    )
  ) 
#> using nlminb BFGS with REML=TRUE 
#> 
#> convergence:  yes

summary(fit)
